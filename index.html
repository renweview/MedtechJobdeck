    <h1>What is this page?</h1>
    <p>The Medtech Jobdeck is designed to help technologists find tech jobs at medical and biotechnical companies. It
      features a database of jobs, often handpicked for aspiring technologists to get their first role in medtech.
      You‚Äôll be able to search for roles based on location, experience-level, company size, date the role was posted,
      among other things.

    <h1>Why should I use your site, hm?</h1>
    <p> We scour the internet everyday for new job openings. Generally given this website is a jobs page, our intended
      users would be most jobseekers. In the future I‚Äôd like to try to use a web scraper and make the jobs page open
      source as well, with an
      associated Discord and Github for folks to contribute towards and ask questions about certain roles or features
      for the web page.</p>
